>3. Custom development may be what you need, but it may not.

It's been a long while since I've heard someone make a case for why they *don't* need a website. For those who don't have an existing website, there's a pretty good consensus  that a website would be great for them. In my experience, the reason that a business may not have a website (or has long put off a website update) has more to do with a lack of time, knowledge, or budget than it does lack of desire. 

Designing and building a website takes an awful lot of time—and sometimes money. But a lot new options come up everyday for how you can get from "*hmm, what should we do about a website*" to "*sweet, I love our website.*" There's no shortage of options these days, but sometimes the number of choices makes picking a direction difficult. In our mind, the most realistic and practical options—meaning they're worth your money—are using an online tool to build your website, or having it fully developed (someone writes all of the code to make the website). There are some other options and services that "make you a website", but these two options are the best directions in our experience. Today, I want to help walk through the "*been there, done that*" for some of the more prominent options to get your web project up and running.

### Online Tools vs. Custom Development

#### Online Tools

If you're a small business or an individual working to get yourself online, you've probably come across tools like Wix, Squarespace, or maybe even a newer tool called Webflow. Wix and Squarespace fall into what we would consider the "template" side of website building. These tools can be a great fit for some people—they allow you to get a professionally designed template customized, loaded with your own content and brand, then get it live fairly quickly and at a fairly low cost. 

Another online website builder is Webflow (mentioned above). This is a more customized approach to using an online tool. You will have more control over building the website from scratch, and it's well suited for technically inclined people who like to get into the weeds with designing and building a website, without taking the time to write code.

#### Custom Development

Another option is to have your website custom developed. We'll go into more detail later about why we think it's often the best option for many businesses, but the long-story-short for it is that anything is possible with custom development.

### Online tools—In Depth

#### Wix & Squarespace

A lot of people tend to stray away from templates due to an opinion about not having a "one of a kind" website. But here's the thing—you're better off with a template website designed by a professional designer than you are having no website at all. So if you know you are short on time or have very simple needs, it might be something worth considering. Once your website is live, you may find that it's useful to your business, and you want to build more content and features. From there, you can begin considering other options. 

One thing that I would caution you about is to be careful when customizing the templates that you select as a starting point. A lot of the templates are carefully designed by talented people—they made the design choices that they made for good reasons, and you can quickly find yourself watering down the original design, and finding that what you ended up with doesn't look nearly as good as the template you chose.

So in our opinion, you should use these tools to add your logo, photos, and copywriting to a template, and be gentle with customizations.

#### Webflow

Webflow is a *very* cool tool. It's a bit of a new kid on the block in the online website builder scene, but it's much more user friendly and customizable than Wix or Squarespace. It feels a lot more like designing and building a website than just personalizing a template. It provides more flexibility with your design, and it often makes customization options more readily available to you. It does require a more technical person to use it efficiently, but if you are planning to design a website, you're likely technical enough to figure it out. The interface feels (to me, at least) familiar, being  reminiscent of any graphic design software that I've used. 

On top of the ease of starting from a blank canvas for design, you have a lot of options for functionality that we've found harder to access in other online website building platforms. Things like linking content together, adding uniquely responsive features, etc., are all more readily available—and you can definitely get into the weeds with adding custom code, more advanced content tools.

We have experience with Webflow, and we can confidently recommend it to use. It's a great option for people who don't have highly custom needs, but you know you need more than Wix or Squarespace can give you.

We think it's a great option for getting a good website at a good price—so we like to recommend it to clients who come to us for help designing and building them a website, but don't need something fully developed. Alex is a pro at using Webflow, and we'd be happy to talk about whether it's a good fit for what you need or not.

### Custom Development—In Depth

#### Flexibility

Even a tool like Webflow can't always provide what you need. For a lot of businesses, there are custom integrations that you need to implement for your website. Things like online scheduling tools, connecting to your calendar to show availability, or online stores are just a few examples of why you might need something a bit more robust.

In cases when you need more, custom development is likely your answer. Most websites that you use everyday have been developed using code, rather than an online website builder. This is partially due to the fact that these tools haven't always existed and partially due to the fact that custom development is more flexible. When asked whether you need a fully custom developed website or not, our answer is usually "*you'll know when you need it."*

#### Performance

There are some other benefits beyond flexibility with custom development. In our opinion, one of the biggest benefits of custom development is performance; you can think more about fast car vs. slow car performance, less about "does it sell things for me"—literally *performance*. You can get into the details if you want to read through some of Google's opinions on page speeds, but the key takeaway is that the faster your website loads content, the better your chances are of engaging you. 

The goal of your website is to provide information about yourself and your business. The people looking for the information shouldn't have to wait for what they want. So make it fast. This is also something that Google has been prioritizing more and more as an SEO factor. If your website is fast and it performs just like you would expect it to, it should be a good website to recommend to someone, right?

#### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

A big draw to most businesses is the search engine optimization (SEO) benefits that custom development offers. For those who aren't up with the website lingo, it just means "how much does Google like me?" 

This is less of a factor for some people, as not everyone needs to rank #1 on Google results for their industry. Sometimes, you need a website to showcase work for prospective clients, or act as a brand validation tool  for prospective clients who want to do their homework on you—brand validation is just a fancy way to say that people like to ask the internet "*is this business any good?*", and you want your website to answer that question enthusiastically, and positively.

So of SEO is an important factor when answering "*why do you need a website?",* then custom development offers a lot of power behind making sure that Google likes you. With having your website custom developed, you'll have a lot of control over the nitty gritty SEO factors of your website.

### Your needs are unique

As you think about your website's needs, it's all about finding the right fit for you and your business. Each direction has it's own benefits and pitfalls, and it can be tricky to navigate. Hopefully you've gotten a good idea of what you might need and found the information above helpful. 

If you aren't sure, we're happy to help you figure it out. We've built websites using all of the options above, and and have opinions on all of them. Whether we're going to help you with the project or not, we won't be shy in letting you know which direction is best suited for what you need.

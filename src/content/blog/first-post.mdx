It’s 2020. The year that you have big goals for your business. If your business is brand new, you’re rethinking the logo you or a friend quickly created so you could launch. For more established businesses, you’re wondering if you should go through a rebrand. It seems like a lot of work and hassle, but thinking it would help you in the long run. 

If you’re in this state of limbo, here are 5 reasons that your business is ready for a facelift: 

### 1. You’re embarrassed by your logo, website, or other parts of your brand.

It happens. You thought you would love the color palette that you picked out, but now it seems childish. When someone asks you for your website url or business card, you cringe while handing over the information. Your brand should be something you have confidence and pride in, not the opposite. 

### 2. You feel like you’re reusing the same thing, over and over again.

It’s repetitive. This can be especially true if you only have a logo. Your brand should be flexible enough that it can be used in many ways, all while promoting a certain aesthetic. If your only choices are a color change, you need more assets. 

### 3. Your vision has expanded. 

This may be reflected in your business’ name or brand. You thought you were only 
going to offer one type of service or product, but you found out you can handle way 
more, and want to do way more. You feel held back by your brand or feel like it doesn’t 
accurately demonstrate what you do. 

### 4. You’re not attracting the clients you want.
    
The clients are coming, which is nice, but they’re not the clients you want. You’re 
struggling to find people who truly value and want exactly what you do. Believe us, they’re out there, your brand just isn’t speaking to them.  

### 5. You’re struggling to raise prices.

You know you’re worth more than what you’re charging. We know how frustrating that 
can be. If you haven’t taken a good, hard look at your brand in connection to this 
problem, you might want to. It could be that while you have a brand, the impression it’s 
giving off doesn’t reflect the value of the service or product you’re offering.
